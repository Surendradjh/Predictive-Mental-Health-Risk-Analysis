st.write("""
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, mental health issues are becoming increasingly common, especially among individuals working in the IT industry. 
To address this growing concern, the goal of this project is to analyze daily activities of individuals, such as age, gender, sleep hours, 
stress levels, physical activity, social interaction, and more. By identifying patterns in this data, we aim to build a machine learning 
model that predicts whether an individual is likely to seek treatment for mental health concerns. This model will help in the early 
identification of at-risk individuals, enabling timely support and intervention to improve mental well-being.

# Objective
st.subheader("Objective")
st.write("""
To thoroughly understand and analyze people's daily activities, a large dataset is essential. However, due to the unavailability of 
open-source datasets containing such confidential information, we researched data from multiple health organizations, including the 
World Health Organization (WHO) and others. From these datasets, we extracted common features (e.g., age, gender, sleep hours, 
stress levels, physical activity, social interaction) for analysis.

Based on the analyzed data, we aim to apply various machine learning algorithms and select the best-performing one to build a predictive model. 
By integrating Generative AI (GenAI), the model will take user inputs and provide personalized suggestions to improve mental well-being.

# Key Steps
st.subheader("Key Steps")
st.write("""
- **Analyze Data**: Study the collected survey data to identify patterns and trends related to mental health.  
- **Apply Algorithms**: Test multiple machine learning algorithms and select the one with the best performance.  
- **Build Model**: Develop a predictive model using the selected algorithm to identify individuals at risk of mental health issues.  
- **Add GenAI**: Integrate Generative AI to provide personalized suggestions based on user inputs.  
- **Provide Help**: Offer actionable tips and recommendations to improve mental health and well-being.
